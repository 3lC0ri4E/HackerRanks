    "# The Hurdle Race Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Lily is a competitive runner and is preparing for a big race. She needs to jump over hurdles of different heights. The height of each hurdle is given as an array, and the height of the highest hurdle is given as an integer. Lily has a jump height `k`, and she needs to determine the number of doses of magic potion she must drink to be able to jump all the hurdles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Lily has a jump height `k`, and she is given an array `h` where each element represents the height of a hurdle. She needs to drink a magic potion if the height of any hurdle exceeds her current jump height. The potion increases her jump height by 1 unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Line**: Two integers, `n` (the number of hurdles) and `k` (Lily's initial jump height).\n",
    "- **Second Line**: An array of integers representing the heights of the hurdles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`\n",
    "- `1 ≤ k ≤ 1000`\n",
    "- `1 ≤ h[i] ≤ 1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print a single integer: the minimum number of doses of magic potion Lily must drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5 4\n",
    "1 6 3 5 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lily's jump height is 4. The highest hurdle is 6, so she needs to drink 2 doses of potion to increase her jump height from 4 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Jump Height**: Lily starts with a jump height `k`.\n",
    "2. **Hurdle Heights**: The heights of the hurdles are given in the array `h`.\n",
    "3. **Determine the Required Height**: The maximum height in the array `h` represents the tallest hurdle Lily has to jump over.\n",
    "4. **Potion Requirement**: If the height of the tallest hurdle is greater than Lily's current jump height, the number of potions needed is the difference between the tallest hurdle height and her current jump height.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hurdleRace(k, height):\n",
    "    # Find the maximum height of the hurdles\n",
    "    max_hurdle = max(height)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Calculate how many doses of potion Lily needs\n",
    "    if max_hurdle > k:\n",
    "        return max_hurdle - k\n",
    "    return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n",
    "    height = list(map(int, input().split()))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    result = hurdleRace(k, height)\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding the Maximum Hurdle**: The `max()` function is used to find the tallest hurdle in the `height` array.\n",
    "2. **Checking Potion Requirement**: If the maximum hurdle height is greater than Lily's current jump height `k`, we compute the difference and return that as the number of potions needed. Otherwise, no potion is required, and we return 0.\n",
    "3. **Input and Output**: The code reads the input values and prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of hurdles. This is because we only need to find the maximum hurdle height, which takes linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently computes the number of potions Lily needs to drink to be able to jump all the hurdles.\n"
