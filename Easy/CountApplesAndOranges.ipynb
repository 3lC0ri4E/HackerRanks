    "# Apple and Orange Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. Using the information given below, determine the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red region**: Denotes the house, where `s` is the start point, and `t` is the endpoint.\n",
    "- **Apple Tree**: Located at point `a`, to the left of the house.\n",
    "- **Orange Tree**: Located at point `b`, to the right of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fruit Landing:\n",
    "- **Distance Calculation**: The fruit lands `d` units from its tree. A negative value of `d` means the fruit falls to the left of the tree, and a positive value means the fruit falls to the right.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Given the values of `d` for `m` apples and `n` oranges, determine how many apples and oranges land on Sam's house, in the inclusive range `[s, t]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of `s` and `t`.\n",
    "2. The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of `a` and `b`.\n",
    "3. The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of `m` and `n`.\n",
    "4. The fourth line contains `m` space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each apple falls from point `a`.\n",
    "5. The fifth line contains `n` space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each orange falls from point `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "- `1 ≤ s, t, a, b, m, n ≤ 10^5`\n",
    "- `-10^5 ≤ d ≤ 10^5`\n",
    "- `a < s < t < b`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print two integers on two different lines:\n",
    "    1. The first integer: the number of apples that fall on Sam's house.\n",
    "    2. The second integer: the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.\n",
