    "# Breaking the Records\n",
    "\n",
    "Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season, she maintains a record of her play, tabulating the number of times she breaks her season record for most and least points in a game. The points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `breakingRecords` has the following parameters:\n",
    "- **int scores[n]**: An array of integers where each integer represents the points scored by Maria in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should return an array with two integers:\n",
    "- The first integer represents the number of times she broke her record for the most points in a game.\n",
    "- The second integer represents the number of times she broke her record for the least points in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format:\n",
    "- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of games.\n",
    "- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the scores in each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`\n",
    "- `0 ≤ scores[i] ≤ 10^6`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Input 0:\n",

    "9\n",
    "10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Sample Output 0:\n",
    "```\n",
    "2 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation:\n",
    "- Maria broke her best record **2 times** (after games 2 and 8).\n",
    "- Maria broke her worst record **4 times** (after games 1, 4, 5, and 7).\n"
