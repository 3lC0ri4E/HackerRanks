    "# Climbing the Leaderboard Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam is playing a game where there are several players and a leaderboard. Each player has a score, and the leaderboard ranks players based on their scores. You are tasked with calculating how a player ranks after they achieve a new score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the current leaderboard and the scores of a new player, you need to determine the player's rank for each new score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Line**: A space-separated list of integers, `ranked`, where each integer is a score on the leaderboard.\n",
    "2. **Second Line**: A space-separated list of integers, `player`, where each integer represents a new score achieved by the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- `1 ≤ ranked[i] ≤ 10^9`\n",
    "- `1 ≤ player[i] ≤ 10^9`\n",
    "- `1 ≤ len(ranked), len(player) ≤ 2 * 10^5`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each score in the `player` list, print the player's rank on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "7 3 2 1\n",
    "5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leaderboard**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "7\n",
    "3\n",
    "2\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "**New Player Scores**: `[5, 6]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first score `5` will rank at position `2` (since `7` is above it, and `3` and `2` are below it).\n",
    "2. The second score `6` will rank at position `1` (since `7` is the only score above it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ranked List**: The leaderboard scores are listed in descending order.\n",
    "2. **Player Scores**: The scores the player achieves are provided.\n",
    "3. For each player score, find its appropriate rank in the leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remove Duplicates**: Since ranks are based on distinct scores, we should remove duplicates from the `ranked` list.\n",
    "2. **Reverse** the list so we can work with the highest to the lowest scores.\n",
    "3. For each player's score, determine their rank by comparing it with the leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def climbingLeaderboard(ranked, player):\n",
    "    # Remove duplicates and reverse the ranked list\n",
    "    ranked = sorted(set(ranked), reverse=True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Initialize result list\n",
    "    result = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Iterate through player scores\n",
    "    idx = len(ranked) - 1  # Start comparing from the lowest ranked score\n",
    "    for score in player:\n",
    "        # Move up in the leaderboard until the player's score is greater\n",
    "        while idx >= 0 and ranked[idx] <= score:\n",
    "            idx -= 1\n",
    "        # Player's rank is the index + 2 (since index is zero-based)\n",
    "        result.append(idx + 2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    ranked = list(map(int, input().split()))\n",
    "    player = list(map(int, input().split()))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    result = climbingLeaderboard(ranked, player)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for res in result:\n",
    "        print(res)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "1. **Removing Duplicates**: The ranked list is first converted to a set to remove duplicate values, then sorted in descending order.\n",
    "2. **Rank Calculation**: For each player's score, we check where it fits in the leaderboard by iterating through the ranked list.\n",
    "3. **Result**: The rank is calculated and stored in the result list. The rank is the index of the first score greater than the player's score plus 1, because ranking is 1-based.\n",
    "4. **Efficient Comparison**: The `idx` pointer helps optimize by only comparing the player's score with the portion of the ranked list that is relevant for that score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is dominated by sorting the ranked list (`O(n log n)`) and iterating over the player's scores (`O(m)`), where `n` is the number of distinct scores and `m` is the number of player scores. Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n log n + m)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently computes the ranks of a player based on the leaderboard and the new scores they achieve.\n"
